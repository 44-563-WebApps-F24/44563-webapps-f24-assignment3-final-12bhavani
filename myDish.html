        <p>My favorite dish is Pongal, which is a popular South-Indian dish made from rice,
             flavored with ghee, pepper, cumin etc. 
            It's a comforting, wholesome meal with a savory taste, perfect for any time of the day. 
            Pongal is often prepared during the Pongal, an Indian festival, to celebrate the harvest season.
