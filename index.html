        <h3>Code Section</h3>
        <p>The paragraph below is a snippet of java script for delaying the execution of 
            function until the current call stack is cleared. It uses defere and setTimeout methods,
            as shown below. The output of below code is to diaplay b first even a is called before b. 
        </p>
        <pre>const defer = (fn, ...args) => setTimeout(fn, 1, ...args);

            defer(console.log, 'a'), console.log('b'); // logs 'b' then 'a'
        </pre>
